Sequence Pattern,Activity B follows directly after activity A.
Parallel Split,One branch splits into two or more paths executing concurrently.
Synchronization,Concurrent paths rejoin before proceeding.
Exclusive Choice,Exactly one of several alternative paths is selected.
Simple Merge,Alternative branches reunite without synchronisation requirements.
Multi-Choice,One or more paths may be taken based on conditions.
Synchronizing Merge,Waits for all active alternative branches before merging.
Structured Loop,Activities repeat until a condition is met.
Deferred Choice,Path decision delayed until first subsequent event occurs.
Interleaved Parallel Routing,Activities executed in any order but not concurrently.
Milestone,Process flow enabled when specific state condition becomes true.
Cancel Case,Terminate all activities of a running instance.
Handover of Work,Responsibility for a case shifts from one resource to another.
Separation of Duties,Two distinct resources must perform specified tasks for the same case.
Case Ownership,One resource responsible for all activities of a case.
Task Automation,System executes activity without human intervention.
KPI,Key Performance Indicator; quantitative metric assessing process performance.

Concept Drift,Change in process behaviour over time altering underlying data distribution.
Sudden Drift,Abrupt replacement of old process variant by a new one at a specific time.
Gradual Drift,Old and new variants coexist during a transition period.
Incremental Drift,"Series of small, continuous changes accumulating into major transformation."
