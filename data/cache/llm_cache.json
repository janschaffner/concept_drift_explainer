Drift #1 describes the strategic changes initiated by the new CFO, which included the suspension of auto-approval as part of a broader governance reform. Drift #2 details an emergency directive that also mandated the suspension of auto-approval due to misuse of delegated authority. Thus, both drifts share a common cause related to the need for stricter compliance and oversight in the payment approval process."
