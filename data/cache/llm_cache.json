The introduction of a new requirement for final approval by supervisors, effective from October 2018, indicates a potential evolution in the approval protocol. This change appears to be a response to identified inconsistencies and audit findings, which could imply that the organization is adopting a more structured approach to align with regulatory standards and improve accountability over time. However, this interpretation remains hypothetical and should be further validated by additional data.",

Key changes, such as the introduction of mandatory pre-approval steps for payment submissions and new requirements for travel expense declarations, reflect an agile methodology focused on continuous improvement and enhanced oversight. While these adjustments suggest a strategic response to identified vulnerabilities and audit findings, further data validation is necessary to confirm their effectiveness and impact on overall process efficiency."
