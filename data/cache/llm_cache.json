This change responds to \nrecurring audit findings involving incomplete or inconsistent data in payment records. \n \nBackground \nA joint review conducted by the Finance Directorate and the Internal Audit Unit revealed that: \n\u2022 Over 12% of prepaid cost records lacked valid permit IDs or had mismatched budget \nnumbers \n\u2022 Several payments were processed despite missing approvals \n\u2022 Project coding errors caused reimbursement delays and retroactive corrections \n \nWhat Is Changing What Is Changing \nStarting 2 July 2018, the travel cost system will enforce automated pre-checks before allowing a \nRequest for Payment to proceed. Specifically: \n\u2022 Valid permit IDs must be attached for all international travel \n\u2022 Budget and project numbers must match those recorded in the permit \n\u2022 Incomplete or \u201cUNKNOWN\u201d entries will block submission \n \nRevised Workflow Requirements \n1. Permit Approval must be complete (SUPERVISOR and DIRECTOR levels) \n2. Metadata fields (Organizational Unit, Task, Budget, Project) must be populated and \nmatch across permit and request \n3. If a permit was not required (e.g., domestic or certain grants), justification must be noted \nin the comment field \n \nSystem Changes \n\u2022 A new error screen will alert users when required fields are missing or inconsistent \n\u2022 Finance staff will no longer manually override blocked submissions",
