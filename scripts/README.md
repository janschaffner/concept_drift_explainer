# Purpose of this Directory

This directory contains a collection of **helper scripts and smaller, focused tests** that were used during the development and debugging of the CDE.

Unlike the formal evaluation harness in the `/tests` directory, these scripts are designed for quick, isolated tests of individual components or sub-chains of the main pipeline. They are not part of the final, formal evaluation of the project but are preserved here for maintainability and future development.
